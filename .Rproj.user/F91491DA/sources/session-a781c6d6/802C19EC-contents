Description: Tools for estimating baseflow in rivers using Bayesian inference in Stan. With BayesFlow, you can easily incorporate covariates to obtain probabilistic estimates of baseflow, capture and propagate uncertainty, and better understand the underlying processes. The package also includes features for imputing missing data and filling gaps on the go. With its user-friendly interface and powerful Bayesian modeling capabilities, BayesFlow is a versatile tool for anyone interested in hydrological modeling and baseflow estimation. The package under development and testing, results should be double-checked for accuracy and consistency.
